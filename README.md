# Installing

1. Install python3
    * On mac, `brew install python3`
2. Create a virtual env
    * Somewhere (outside of the repository) type: `python3 -m venv ./globenv`
    * Instead of globenv, can be anything you want =P
3. Active virtual env (need to be done everytime you start a new shell session)
    * `source ./globenv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies (need to be done in the first time and when new libs are added)
    * On our git root folder
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Rock and run
    * Now `python` is actually `python3` =P
    * Check by typing `python --version` and seeing if it is 3.something
    * Run your scripts with `python file.py`
    * Profit
